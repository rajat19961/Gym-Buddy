The application allows users to filter exercises according to body parts, movements, and gym equipment, making it easy to find the perfect exercise for their workout.

Additionally, the application has an integration with YouTube that allows users to watch detailed videos of each exercise, providing them with a visual guide to proper form and technique. Users can also search exercises by their names, body parts or movement.

The application has a responsive user interface built with Material-UI, a popular user interface library that implements Google's Material Design guidelines. This ensures that the application looks and feels great on both desktop and mobile devices. Material-UI also provides ready-to-use UI components that follow material design and make it easy to implement a professional-looking interface.

The combination of a comprehensive exercise database, video integration, and easy-to-use interface makes this gym application made in ReactJS the perfect tool for users looking to take control of their fitness and reach their goals.
